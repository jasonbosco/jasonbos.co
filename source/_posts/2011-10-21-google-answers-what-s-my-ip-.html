title: Google answers "What's my IP?"

<p>I'm behind a router most of the time and for ages, I've typed "What's my IP" in Google and clicked on the first
    result to get my public IP address. But today I typed the phrase into Google and found that now Google answers the
    query by itself. Saves me an extra click!</p>
