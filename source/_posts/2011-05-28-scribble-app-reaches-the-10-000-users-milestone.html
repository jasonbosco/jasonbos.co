<p>It's been thrilling to watch <a href="http://wreally.com" target="_blank">our</a> <a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offpaifnchmpbnjhjbhpdffahlofdkfb" target="_blank">Scribble App</a> grow through all these months. With a 4.58 user rating and 10,018 users as of today, Scribble has officially
    crossed the 10,000 users milestone. We were there on Day One when the Chrome Web Store opened its gates. In two days
    <a href="http://jasonbos.co/scribble-makes-it" target="_blank">Scribble had 439 installs</a> and showed up on the
    Featured section of the utilities category. The early mover advantage helped us get enough attention from the press.
    We were soon featured on <a

<p>Meanwhile we ironed out minor bugs and were wide open to <a

        href="https://twitter.com/#!/josedaniel/status/14314564833247232" target="_blank">comments</a> and <a
        href="https://twitter.com/#!/daviesga/status/15516180362039297" target="_blank">reactions</a>. One feature that
    was most asked for was a way to access notes from multiple browsers. Being a browser-based note-taking app, it was
    only a matter of time that users needed a Sync feature to access their notes from multiple places. And thus the sync
    feature was born. Though the sync feature took a while to catch on, as of today we have&nbsp;1655 registered sync
    users and we're adding new users every day.</p>
<p>Thank you to all our users who helped make Scribble a success!&nbsp;We couldn't have done it without you. Of course
    :)&nbsp;Also, thank you to all the people who sent in words of encouragement. You kept us going!&nbsp;</p>
