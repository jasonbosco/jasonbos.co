<p>Today morning I realized that my iPhone alarm didn't go off. Well what do you know, looks like it's a 'Year 2011'
    bug. Apparently people have even missed their flights, thanks to the bug :&nbsp;<a

<p>Dear Apple, I need my alarm back soon. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Apparently the alarm doesn't work only on Jan 1 and Jan 2nd of 2011. It's Jan 3rd now, and
    the alarm works now!&nbsp;</p>
