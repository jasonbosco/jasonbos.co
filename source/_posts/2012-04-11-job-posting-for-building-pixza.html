<p>And so I was looking at the analytics for <a href="http://pixza.com/" target="_blank">Pixza</a>. There was a referral
    from gamedev.net. I was curious to find out where Pixza was mentioned on <a href="http//www.gamedev.net"
                                                                                target="_blank">gamedev.net</a>.&nbsp;And
    I found this post:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamedev.net/classifieds/item/306-looking-for-html5-programmer/"
                               target="_blank">http://www.gamedev.net/classifieds/item/306-looking-for-html5-programmer/</a>.

<p>Someone wants to hire a person to build a game similar to Pixza! I wonder why he mentions that we didn't respond to
    his attempts to get in touch with us.</p>

<p>- How about a year and a half in the midst of undergrad college work?&nbsp;</p>

    Pixza from scratch might not take such a long time. We didn't have these luxuries when we started working on Pixza.
