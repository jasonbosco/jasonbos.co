title: Change host-name on a mac
published: true
---
<p>I have the host-name on my MacBook set as Jason-MBP. But when I connect to the campus wireless network the hostname
    automatically changes to something else. This started causing problems when starting erlang shells with my original
    host-name. So I had to change it back to my original hostname to get the erl shell working. Found this after a bit
    of googling:&nbsp;</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
    <div class="code">
        <pre>sudo scutil --set HostName Jason-MBP.local</pre>
    </div>
</div>
