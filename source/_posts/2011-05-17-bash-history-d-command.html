<p>I often find myself typing passwords into the bash shell in a hurry before I can type the command which is going to
    ask for the password! This text gets into the bash history which really embarassing. To remove an item from the bash
    history, type&nbsp;</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
    <div class="code">
        <pre>history</pre>
    </div>
</div>

<p>to view the items in the history along with the offset. Now type</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
    <div class="code">
        <pre>history -d offset</pre>
    </div>
</div>

<p>where offset is the one specified in the output of the previous command.</p>
