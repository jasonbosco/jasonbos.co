title: IE8 - A legacy web browser?
published: true

<p>Found this on one of the Chrome Web Store's Documentation pages: <a
        href="http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/articles/launching.html">http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/articles/launching.html</a>
</p>
<p>"We also recommend that you add support for Google Chrome Frame, a plugin that adds Google Chrome's capabilities,
    including its HTML5 features, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to legacy browsers</span> such as
        IE6, IE7, and IE8.</strong>"</p>
<p>Wow that was subtle.</p>
