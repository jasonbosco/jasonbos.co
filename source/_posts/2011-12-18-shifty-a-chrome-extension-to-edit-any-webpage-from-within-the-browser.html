title: ! 'Shifty: A Chrome Extension To Edit Any Webpage From Within The Browser'
published: true
---
<p>When&nbsp;<a href="http://kishorelive.com" target="_blank">Kishore</a> and I iterate over product designs, I often
    feel the need for a tool that will allow me to propose changes to a HTML mockup by simply clicking and dragging DOM
    elements from within the browser, instead of taking a screen shot of the page and editing the image.</p>
<p>Thus was born <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dlkpkmehbgbpobaidinekoedabkdidnb" target="_blank">Shifty</a>
    - a Chrome extension to move DOM elements or edit text on any webpage, from within the browser. My workflow is now
    as easy as turning the extension on, moving elements around and editing text and finally taking a screenshot to
    capture my changes.</p>
<p>You should give the extension a shot and let me know how it goes:&nbsp;<a

</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the extension in action:</p>

<p>In the near future, I plan to add a way to take screenshots from within the extension. More feature suggestions,
    feedback and bug reports are welcome!</p>
