title: Facebook Email System Open To Spam?
published: true
---
<p>I signed into my Facebook account and received a notification about "Claiming my facebook email address". My facebook
    email address is &lt;MyFBUserName&gt;@facebook.com. I can't change it to anything else. It defaults to my FB user
    name. So much for spam. Can't I write a scraper that will google for common names (<a
            href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=sam+facebook">http://www.google.com/search?q=sam+facebook</a>),
    get a list of FB user names and then tack @facebook.com and start sending spam? I hope there are good privacy
    mechanisms to prevent this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I already notice a few annoying quirks with the UI. Among them:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When I scroll a long conversation, the middle pane scrolls, which is quite awkward and quite unlike any other FB
    page.</p>
<p>2. When sending a message (email) to a regular email address, I cannot set the subject line. Instead it defaults to
    "Conversation with MY FULL NAME" on the receiving end.</p>
<p>I guess the UI issues will be ironed out over time, but I'm quite concerned about the spam issue. Has anyone already
    tried writing a scraper? Just curious! ;-)</p>
