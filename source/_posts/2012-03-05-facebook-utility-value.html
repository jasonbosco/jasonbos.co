<p>3.30am</p>
<p>Working on assignment</p>
<p>Need to test code on nunki (USC server)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upload code</p>
<p>Compile</p>
<p>Spawn 10 background instances of the program to see if they work in all cases</p>
<p>Hmmm, only one instance spews out output. Whatever happened to my other instances.</p>
<p>ps aux | grep java</p>
<p>No more instances show up</p>
<p>But hey look there's another user running a similar program, using the same package name</p>
<p>There's someone else doing the assignment at this hour!</p>
<p>I wonder who it could be?</p>
<p>USC campus directory -&gt; Search for user name (from ps output) -&gt; Get full name&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmmm, do I know this guy?</p>
<p>Ctrl+T -&gt; facebook.com</p>
<p>Search for full name</p>
<p>Hey look we have 5 mutual friends</p>
<p>Wonder how these guys know each other</p>
<p>Hey look he's worked here here AND here!</p>
<p>What oh what would I have done without Facebook</p>
<p>Now where was I?</p>
<p>Oh snap, I'm writing this post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to my assignment.</p>
<p>3.45am</p>
