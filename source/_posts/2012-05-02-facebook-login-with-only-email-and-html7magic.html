title: Facebook Login With Only Email and html7magic?

<p>I happened to stumble on Carl's Jr.'s Facebook page today and particularly on this post (for no particular reason, I
    should add):&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/91702965455/posts/10151579104835456" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/91702965455/posts/10151579104835456</a>

</p>

<p>and I quickly noticed the login area on the top right. It only had an email field and a login button. (I was not
    signed into Facebook when I visited the page.) For a brief moment I thought Facebook had finally done away with the
    concept of passwords somehow!</p>
<p>So I clicked on the login button and it took to me the standard Facebook login page. Oh well, passwords are here to
    stay.</p>
<p>But here's the question: why would Facebook do this? Why would they place only an email field on that page and not a
    password field? Isn't it an extra step for users to click on the login button and then be directed to another page
    to enter their password?</p>
<p>And then I wondered if this was a CSS issue, and looked at the source code:&nbsp;
<p>

</p>
</p>
<p>And I was able to confirm that it wasn't a CSS issue causing the password field to be hidden. There wasn't any input
    field for a password on that page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now I found something else that's interesting. A class named "html7magic". What am I to expect?! Is FB out there
    using HTML 7 secretely and somehow translating their HTML7 code to HTML5 to work with current browsers?!&nbsp;</p>
