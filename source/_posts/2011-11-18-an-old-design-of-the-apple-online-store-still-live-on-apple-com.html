title: An Old Design Of The Apple Online Store Still Live On Apple.com
published: true
---
<p>Today I had a question for Apple Sales and I <a href="https://www.google.com/?q=apple%20live%20chat" target="_blank">googled</a>
    for "apple live chat". The third link in my search results pointed to this page:&nbsp;<a
            href="http://www.apple.com/r/store/livechat/" target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/r/store/livechat/</a>&nbsp;-
    "Apple Store - Live Chat".&nbsp;<img

<p>It looks like it is an old page just lying around on apple.com. Ah the classic "Mac look" back in the day. It
    reminded me of the first time I saw a Mac at a design studio in a digital press when I was in 8th grade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried submitting values into the form and it didn't work. The form points to chat.info.apple.com which resolves to
    17.112.147.216.&nbsp;</p>
