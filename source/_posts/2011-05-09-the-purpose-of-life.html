<p>Searching for an answer to the age old question of "What is the purpose of life?" I realized, to start off with, that
    the purpose of life is to simply live - to live one day at a time and enjoy it, taking in the experiences&nbsp;each
    day brings along with it, both the happy ones and the challenging ones. The purpose of existence is to
    exist.&nbsp;</p>
