title: DOS attack on a free service? Come on.
published: true

<p>It's incredibly frustrating when someone launches a DOS attack on a <span
        style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>free</strong></span> service like <a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offpaifnchmpbnjhjbhpdffahlofdkfb/" target="_blank">Scribble</a>.
    Come on, we host the app and give you cloud sync for free, paying for the server resources ourselves and then
    someone does this. So not cool.</p>
<p>Well, I guess there's no point complaining. We'll do our best to tackle the attack.</p>
