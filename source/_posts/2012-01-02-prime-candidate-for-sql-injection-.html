<p>I happened to stumble on this site which embeds the SQL query in their URL!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the first thing that occured to me was to change that SQL query to something fitting, may be
    replace the SELECT query with a DELETE? Nah.. I shouldn't be malicious I thought. And so I tried a simple UPDATE of
    one of the attributes, something which if it went through, I could easily revert back and not cause any damage. And
    so I tried an UPDATE query. Good for them, they atleast restricted the DB user to only perform SELECTs on the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here I am thinking "I should sanitize all my input" worrying about SQL injection and stuff. And I see this. Made my
    day or should I say year. Happy New Year!</p>
