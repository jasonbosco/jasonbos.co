<p>I was curious how people casually browsing through the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore" target="_blank">Chrome
    web store</a> would discover <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offpaifnchmpbnjhjbhpdffahlofdkfb"
                                    target="_blank">Scribble</a>. And so I opened up the Chrome Web Store and browsed
    through the first few tile sets of apps on the home page. I didn't find <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offpaifnchmpbnjhjbhpdffahlofdkfb"
            target="_blank">Scribble</a> there. Oh well, I told myself, referals from <a
            href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/27/chrome-extensions-small-business/" target="_blank">news</a> <a
            href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2010/12/08/5-must-have-free-apps-from-the-chrome-app-store/"
            target="_blank">sites</a>,&nbsp;<a
            href="http://weboftech.com/chrome/5-best-chrome-offline-apps-chrome-web-store-free-apps/" target="_blank">blogs</a>
    and <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/253433/5_businesssavvy_chrome_apps.html" target="_blank">other
        sites</a> are our primary traffic source I guess.</p>
<p class="p1">Then I went to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/app/9-utilities" target="_blank">Utilities
    section</a>&nbsp;since we had posted <a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offpaifnchmpbnjhjbhpdffahlofdkfb" target="_blank">Scribble</a>
    under the Utilities category and there it was - <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offpaifnchmpbnjhjbhpdffahlofdkfb"
            target="_blank">Scribble</a> featured right on top of the Utilties section with the biggest banner we had
    uploaded. There were three apps featured on the top in rotation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> - A major player in the note-taking app category
    </li>
    <li>Springpad</li>
    <li>and&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offpaifnchmpbnjhjbhpdffahlofdkfb" target="_blank">SCRIBBLE</a>!&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>

    </li>
</ol>

<p>So that's how people find out about Scribble!&nbsp;</p>
